Question 2
The definition of free software consists of four freedoms (freedoms 0 through 3). Which of the following is NOT one of the freedoms that are part of the definition?
 The freedom to study how the program works, and adapt it to your needs.
 --> The freedom to prevent users from using the software for undesirable purposes.
 The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help your neighbor.
 The freedom to improve the program, and release your improvements to the public, so that the whole community benefits.

Question 3
In R the following are all atomic data types EXCEPT
 integer
 complex
 numeric
 --> table

Question 4
If I execute the expression x <- 4L in R, what is the class of the object `x' as determined by the `class()' function?
 numeric
 character
 --> integer
 matrix

Question 5
What is the class of the object defined by the expression x <- c(4, "a", TRUE)?
 numeric
 --> character
 logical
 mixed

Question 6
If I have two vectors x <- c(1,3, 5) and y <- c(3, 2, 10), what is produced by the expression cbind(x, y)?
 a 2 by 3 matrix
 a 3 by 3 matrix
 a 2 by 2 matrix
 --> a matrix with 2 columns and 3 rows

Question 7
A key property of vectors in R is that
 a vector cannot have have attributes like dimensions
 elements of a vector can be of different classes
 the length of a vector must be less than 32,768
 --> elements of a vector all must be of the same class

Question 8
Suppose I have a list defined as x <- list(2, "a", "b", TRUE). What does x[[2]] give me?
 a list containing a character vector with the elements "a" and "b".
 a list containing character vector with the letter "a".
 --> a character vector containing the letter "a".
 a list containing the number 2 and the letter "a".

Question 9
Suppose I have a vector x <- 1:4 and y <- 2:3. What is produced by the expression x + y?
 an error.
 --> an integer vector with the values 3, 5, 5, 7.
 a numeric vector with the values 1, 2, 5, 7.
 an numeric vector with the values 3, 5, 5, 7.

Question 10
Suppose I have a vector x <- c(17, 14, 4, 5, 13, 12, 10) and I want to set all elements of this vector that are greater than 10 to be equal to 4. What R code achieves this?
-->  x[x >= 11] <- 4
 x[x >= 10] <- 4
 x[x == 10] <- 4
 x[x < 10] <- 4
